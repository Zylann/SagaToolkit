Saga Toolkit
------------

SagaTK is a set of tools for audio plays production.


Warning
------------

This is very experimental and tailored for my own use so far. I will probably improve it over time.


Features
----------

The first currently developped tool is a compiler that parses audio plays 
written in a custom form of Markdown, and outputs fancy HTML pages that are
easy to use by the actors.

Supported stuff:
- Set of model classes for sagas, episodes, scenes, characters etc.
- Convert scenario text files from custom Markdown to rich HTML
- Read and write Reaper DAW files

I started to write this tool because I often write stuff on
my smartphone, in raw text (because f*** apps), but I wanted
to provide a better look and feel to people I share my files with.
I implement other stuff in it for fun.
